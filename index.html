        <p>I Like this cartoon character a lot. Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like Pokémon with powerful electrical abilities. Pikachu is the best-known species of Pokémon, largely due to its appearance in the anime series as the starter Pokémon of the protagonist, Ash Ketchum. Pikachu's design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori.
            <br /><br />
            Pikachu is a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years, as well as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.ikachu's design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Blue, for the Game Boy.
